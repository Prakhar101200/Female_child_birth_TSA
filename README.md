# Time Series Analysis Project: Predicting Daily Female Births

#Overview

This project aims to perform time series analysis on daily female birth data to predict future birth counts. The dataset contains daily total female births in California in the year 1959.

#Dataset
The dataset is provided in a CSV format named "daily-total-female-births-CA.csv" is provided from the eduonix learning center.
It consists of two columns: "Date" and "Births", representing the date of the observation and the corresponding number of female births, respectively.
The dataset contains daily observations over a certain period.

#Approach
#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the time series data to identify patterns, trends, and seasonality.
Calculate summary statistics and explore the distribution of female birth counts.
Identify outliers or missing values that need to be addressed.

#Model Selection:

After collecting all the important information from the data we went with model training. 
For  this, we selected ARIMA first and trained our data with it. But, due to less accuracy in the prediction we decided to find another alternative model our dataset. Therefore, we went with the Holtwinter's model which gave us an exceptional accuracy score with our training with multiple experiments with the parameters.

#Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

#Results
The model created with the holtwinter's algorithm gave us the best results. Therefore, we went with the holtwinter's model. 

#Hardships Faced
Low accuracy: With both models we used for our training gave us bad prediction results at start. This led to confusion doubts about the model I was creating.
Long Hours of Experimenting: Although we got the best results with holtwinter's model. But, with both models we trained, we struggled with experimenting with the parameters such as the best pdq combination that gave us the best results in the ARIMA model and experimenting with the seasonal_period parameter to find the perfect fit for achieving the best prediction results in the holtwinter's model. But, with numerous fails and trails and errors we secured the best outputs with both of the models but went with best scoring model among them. 

#Personal Reflection

Persistence and Learning: Despite the challenges, the project provided an opportunity to learn and grow as a coder. The perseverance to overcome obstacles ultimately led to successful results.

Room for Improvement: Acknowledging that there is always room for improvement, future iterations of the project can focus on refining the code and exploring additional techniques for further enhancing accuracy.

#Future Work

Future enhancements and improvements to the Female Child Daily Birth may include:

Fine-tuning the model architecture and parameters for better performance. Exploring advanced techniques to create more accurate predicting model. 

#Conclusion
This project aims to provide accurate predictions of daily female births using time series analysis techniques. By exploring different models and evaluating their performance, we can identify the most suitable approach for forecasting future birth counts.
